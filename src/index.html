        <h3>The Need</h3>
        <p>Engineers writing a technical report or a social media specialist condensing it into a tweet must work with each other to meet the company's and their audiences’ needs. But often they walk into their corporate jobs with every skill except these
          two essential ones: writing and collaboration.</p>
