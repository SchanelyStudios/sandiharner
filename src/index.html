        <h3>The Need</h3>
        <p>
					Engineers writing a technical report or a social media specialist
					condensing it into a tweet must work with each other to meet the
					company's and their audiencesâ€™ needs. But often they walk into their
					corporate jobs with every skill except these two essential ones:
					writing and collaboration.
