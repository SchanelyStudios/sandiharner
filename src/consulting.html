					As a writing consultant, I want to help your company improve their
					writing skills to better communicate your company goal. As a former
					writing professor, I have addressed various issues writers face and
					created workshops to solve those problems. In addition to these following
					workshops, I can also mix and match technique to best fit your company
					needs. I can provide half-day, full-day, or series sessions.

					&ldquo;Sandi Harner is nothing short of an expert on clear and strong
					writing... Her expertise proved helpful again when she gave a grammar
					and writing seminar here at American Electric Power. I was genuinely
					impressed with both how she chose the most important points out of a
					college semester&rsquo;s worth of material and how she interacted with the
					audience, keeping them engaged and entertained along the way. I give Mrs.
					Harner&rsquo;s work my highest recommendation.&rdquo;
