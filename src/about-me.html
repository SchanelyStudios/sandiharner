			<p>
				Throughout my career of thirty-six years, I have learned, taught, and
				used writing skills and collaboration methods in different contexts to
				solve unique challenges.
			</p>
			<p>
				I served as a professor at Cedarville University from 1981 to 2017. In
				1985, I developed the Professional Writing and Information Design
				program. In addition to teaching students, I advised the Society of
				Professional Writers (SPW), our program&rsquo;s student organization.
				I have also worked with different companies and organizations to help
				their employees improve their writing skills. Please view my resume
				for further information on those companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				From 1998 to 2006, I served on the International Board of Directors
				for the Society for Technical Communication (STC) as Assistant to the
				President for Academic and Research Programs. In January of 2002, I
				coauthored <i>Technical Marketing Communication</i> as part of the
				Allyn &amp; Bacon Series in Technical Communicaiton from Pearson.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the fall of 2016, I completed my certification as a Myers-Briggs
				consultant. I have always been fascinated with Myers-Briggs and how
				it can be used to better understand yourself and those around you. I
				am excited to help companies and groups relate better as individuals
				and teams.
