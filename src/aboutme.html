<p>Throughout my career of thirty-six years, I have learned, taught, and used writing skills and collaboration methods in different contexts to solve unique challenges.</p>

<p>I served as a professor at Cedarville University from 1981 to 2017. In 1985, I developed the Professional Writing and Information Design program. In addition to teaching students, I advised the Society of Professional Writers (SPW), our program&#39;s student organization. I have also worked with different companies and organizations to help their employees improve their writing skills. Please view my resume for further information on those companies.</p>

<p>From 1998 to 2006, I served on the International Board of Directors for the Society for Technical Communication (STC) as Assistant to the President for Academic and Research Programs. In January of 2002, I coauthored <i>Technical Marketing Communication</i> as part of the Allyn &amp; Bacon Series in Technical Communicaiton from Pearson.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2016, I completed my certification as a Myers-Briggs consultant. I have always been fascinated with Myers-Briggs and how it can be used to better understand yourself and those around you. I am excited to help companies and groups relate better as individuals and teams.</p>
